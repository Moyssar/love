          laughing out of nowhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          I loved her because of her beauty, loyalty, honesty, respect, and the
          way she filled my heart with a kind of love I had never felt before,
          And she's the "supportive" type.
          <br />
          I can't forget the way she makes me feel as soon as I hear her voice,
          one of the best feelings ever.
          <br />
          I was honest and loyal to her as well, and I'm trying to make her the
          happiest person alive.
